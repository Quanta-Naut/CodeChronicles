### **Commands:**

1. **`CodeChronicles: Set Interval`**
	 **Set Interval** command allows you to set the interval at which the summary should be merged. The range of the interval is from 25 minutes to 80 minutes.
	 Every **x** minutes (within the range of 25 to 80 minutes), the summary is merged.

	 Hit **Enter**. And type in a valid minute between **25 - 80 minutes** 
	 ![setInterval2.png](images/setInterval2.png)
	 

2. **`CodeChronicles: Show Repository`**

	![showRepo1.png](images/showRepo1.png)
	
	Hit **Enter**. Here in the dialog box below, you can select:
	- **GitHub Repo**: Opens the GitHub repository in your browser where the summary is stored.

	![showRepo2.png](images/showRepo2.png)

3. **`CodeChronicles: Clear Configuration`**
	**Clear Configuration** removes the stored GitHub repository and deletes the local folder where all summaries are stored (located in the local documents folder). This can be used if any mistakes are made during the setup.
	
	![clearConf1.png](images/clearConf1.png)
	
	All data gets cleared.
	
	![clearConf2.png](images/clearCOnf2.png)

4. **`CodeChronicles: Configure`**
	**Configure** command is used to set up the GitHub repository where all the summary merging happens. In the background, it automatically creates a local folder to store all the summaries.
	
	![conf1.png](images/conf1.png)
	
	If the configuration is already set, the command will ask for confirmation:
	- **Yes (Y):** Proceeds with reconfiguration.
	- **No (N):** Cancels the configuration process."
	
	![conf2.png](images/conf2.png)
	
	While configuring, you will be prompted to enter your GitHub repository link. Ensure the link ends with `.git` (e.g., `https://github.com/Quanta-Naut/CodeChronicles.git`)
	
	![conf4.png](images/conf4.png)
	
	If everything is configured correctly, you will receive the message: 
	**`CodeChronicles: Successfully Configured Repository.`**

5. **`CodeChronicles: Generate Summary`**
	**Generate Summary** command forces the generation of the summary and merges it to the GitHub repository, bypassing the set interval.
	
	![gen-sum1.png](images/gen-sum1.png)
	
	If everything is configured correctly, you will receive the following message:
	**`CodeChronicles: Progress has been merged with the GitHub repository.`**
